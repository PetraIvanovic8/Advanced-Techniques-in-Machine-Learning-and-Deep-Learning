### Assignment 5
This assignment covered sentiment analysis with recurrent models, building a simple chatbot using a seq-to-seq model, understanding attention in transformers, and utilizing BERT for question answering. Techniques I utilized involved applying RNN, LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, implementing a seq-to-seq model with Luong attention for a chatbot, exploring the mechanism of attention in transformers, and leveraging BERT for sophisticated question answering tasks. This assignment provided hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, showcasing the practical application of state-of-the-art NLP techniques.
