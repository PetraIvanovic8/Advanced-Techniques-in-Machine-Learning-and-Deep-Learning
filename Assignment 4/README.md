### Assignment 4
This assignment engaged in a detailed exploration of various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, transfer learning strategies, weakly and semi-supervised learning for image classification, and Siamese networks for face recognition. Techniques I used involved calculating the number of parameters in networks like AlexNet and VGG, understanding inception modules, applying ResNet50 for transfer learning with fine-tuning and feature extraction, and evaluating Siamese networks with different loss functions. I utilized PyTorch for implementing neural networks, focusing on practical applications in image classification and face recognition.
