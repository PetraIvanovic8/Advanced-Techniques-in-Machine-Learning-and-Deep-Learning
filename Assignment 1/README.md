### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/PetraIvanovic8/Advanced-Techniques-in-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/2978ca6e00c5d66b61f7a2dfcdfcd1f7fab900ea/Assignment%201)
This assignment delved into advanced data science concepts including bias-variance tradeoff, KNN hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation, algorithm comparison for document retrieval, and logistic regression with regularization. Techniques I used involved generating and analyzing datasets to understand bias and variance, utilizing sklearn for KNN with varied hyperparameters, creating confusion matrices and evaluating algorithms based on precision, recall, and F1 scores, and leveraging sklearn's logistic regression with L1 and L2 penalties to examine the impact of regularization on model performance. This comprehensive assignment provided hands-on experience with Python and sklearn, demonstrating the practical application and deep understanding of key machine learning concepts.
