### Assignment 2
This assignment examined algorithmic performance scaling and the precision-recall-ROC relationship using datasets from OpenML and theoretical insights from a key paper. Techniques I used included data summarization, training set subsampling for Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting classifiers, learning curve generation, and training time analysis. Further, the assignment explored Perceptron algorithm implementation, comparing perceptron criterion and hinge-loss, and analyzed linear separability in datasets, introducing concepts of linear classifiers and nonlinear transformations. To solve this assignment I used Python, sklearn, and custom algorithm implementation, demonstrating practical machine learning application and theoretical analysis skills.
