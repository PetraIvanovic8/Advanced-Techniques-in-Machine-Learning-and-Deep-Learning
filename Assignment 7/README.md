### Assignment 7
This final assignment tackled asynchronous SGD staleness, data parallelism in PyTorch, SSD model inferencing with ONNX, deep reinforcement learning concepts, and an analysis of ML cloud platforms. It involved theoretical analysis and practical implementation, including calculating gradient staleness in a distributed training setup, experimenting with PyTorch's DataParallel for synchronous SGD across GPUs, deploying an SSD model for object detection using ONNX, and exploring deep RL algorithms and architectures. Additionally, the assignment included a comparison of ML cloud services from IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon based on various criteria such as supported frameworks, compute units, and model lifecycle management tools.
